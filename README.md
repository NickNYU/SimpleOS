# Self-learning Project on Operating Systems

## Introduction
Welcome to the self-learning project on Operating Systems! This project is designed to help you understand the fundamental concepts, principles, and implementation details of operating systems. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced developer aiming to deepen your knowledge, this project provides resources and guidance to facilitate your learning journey.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of operating systems, including their architecture, functionalities, and design principles. By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain the basic concepts and components of operating systems.
- Understand the role of an operating system in managing hardware resources.
- Implement key operating system functionalities, such as process management, memory management, file systems, and device drivers.
- Analyze and troubleshoot common issues in operating systems.
- Explore advanced topics in operating systems, such as distributed systems and real-time operating systems.

## Resources
To accomplish the objectives of this project, you can utilize various learning resources, including:
- Textbooks: Refer to classic operating systems textbooks such as "Operating System Concepts" by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin, and Greg Gagne.
- Online Courses: Enroll in online courses on platforms like Coursera, edX, or Udemy that offer comprehensive coverage of operating systems.
- Tutorials and Documentation: Explore tutorials, documentation, and guides available online for specific operating system concepts and technologies.
- Open Source Projects: Contribute to open-source operating system projects or explore their source code to gain practical insights.
